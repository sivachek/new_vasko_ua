Any business is always a balance of debts and receivables. As a matter of practice, at different stages of its life cycle an enterprise may face the impact of negative factors; the latter may lead to the temporary impossibility of servicing its own obligations (insolvency), or to effectively collect receivables due. There are plenty of such factors in modern Ukraine. For example, devaluation of local currency, seasonal fluctuations in demand for products, other factors of changing market conditions, banking system risks and government interference.
