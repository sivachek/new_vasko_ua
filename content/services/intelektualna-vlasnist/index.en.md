Gustave Flaubert said: "Without ideality, there is no grandeur; without grandeur there is no beauty".

When implemented, ideality becomes an innovation. Nowadays, innovations are more relevant than ever. However, all innovations require due legal protection. Such legal protection may be provided by our associates, specialising in intellectual property matters.
