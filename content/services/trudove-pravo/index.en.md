Changes in Ukrainian and international labor regulations are vitally important for both global and local business. Expanding globalization of the economy makes the role of labor regulations more significant. The activities of large corporations and small companies in Ukraine require clear compliance with the requirements of labor legislation, deep knowledge and understanding of labor law.

During the years of our work, we have created a significant practice of labor law, representing the interests of our clients in matters of different levels of complexity and scope. Our attorneys have extensive experience in advising corporate management on all aspects of labor law. We use a pre-planned and preventive approach and principles to avoid potential problems at the stage of structuring the projects and drafting relevant documents for clients.
