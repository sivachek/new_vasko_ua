A dynamically developing business is at a certain stage faced with a competition problem (for example, manufacturers of similar products), as well as dependence on suppliers of raw materials or components. An effective way of solving these situations may be to merge with other relevant businesses. In the language of lawyers such deals are called mergers and acquisitions. Returning to the previous example, in the case of a competitor, it is about horizontal merger, and in the case of the supplier – it is vertical.

Typically, the preparation of such transactions shall include a comprehensive legal audit – due diligence. Such an audit should include an analysis of the tax, contractual, judicial, corporate, labor and regulatory aspects of the acquisition target entity, the parties to the transaction and directly the acquisition agreement.
