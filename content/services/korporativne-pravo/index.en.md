Corporation is a unique invention of modern civilization. For an active and reasonable businessperson a corporation is an instrument that from one hand allows personalizing his own investment, and, on the other hand, to separate the risks associated with such an investment from the investor's personal assets and from his other projects. In fact, the number of independent entities to be created by an investor may be unlimited.
