In the conditions of instability of the Ukrainian legal system, a significant part of private clients chooses foreign jurisdictions to preserve certain types of assets. However, the template solutions that exist on the market today mostly do not consider the latest global trends in the work of fiscal authorities in most countries of the world. Of course, it is the issue of deoffshorization.
