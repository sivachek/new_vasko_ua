Traditionally, trade is a very attractive industry for entrepreneurs of all scales. The core feature of trade as a tool for the permanent exchange of goods is the high turnover of cash, and hence a rapid increase in gross income.

In addition, in order to succeed in trading for a reasonable entrepreneur, it is important to take into account the significant risks that can hinder the dynamic development. These are issues related to logistics, import and export, storage, transportation, certification, distribution, and rental or constructing retail facilities.
