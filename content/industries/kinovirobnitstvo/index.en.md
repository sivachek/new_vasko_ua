The Ukrainian film industry progresses rapidly. Film Production is extremely interesting, exciting and multifaceted. Such multifacetedness derives from a large number of people involved in making a film. Among them are producers, authors of the film (Film Director, Screenwriter, Film Music Composer, Art Director, Director of Photography), actors, and other personnel. Renting equipment and locations, catering, etc., should also be considered.

That is why a legal support of the film production includes the drafting and implementing of a wide range of contracts concluded with the creative group, actors and involved personnel, as well as with the relevant contracting organizations, copyright holders.

The VASKO Law Office has significant expertise in providing legal support on all issues arising in the process of film production. We understand both the legal field in which the production, author's team and other participants in the film production work, as well as the essence of the process of filmmaking â€“ from creative aspects to business logic of the production cycle.
